## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It took me a full day to develop this. My major obstacle was to create responsive design.
I took this challenge to confront myself with where I am standing currently with my design skills. I learned that I have a lot to learn to become more effective at writing SCSS.
Still have problems understanding the Flexbox properties, media queries and mixins.
